# AppDomainExample
A .NET tool that uses AppDomain's to enable dynamic execution and escape detection.

This is a work-in-progress - a collection of my thoughts and half-baked ideas when I threw too much time into the thrash. I probably don't know what I'm doing, have probably done things in obscure/dumb ways, and may inaccurately describe most things. All criticisms and help welcome.

## Overall Goals
1. Write something dank to help with demonstrating risk during engagements.
2. Defeat current protections and detection mechanisms.
3. Find ways to detect and prevent #2.

Until this project is finished into an actual tool, [the Wiki](https://github.com/xfox64x/AppDomainExample/wiki) will serve as my documentation of understanding and progress, to avoid cluttering up this README.
